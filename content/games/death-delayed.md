date: 2023-02-12
description: Helen never thought that her decision to travel by plane would save her life.
solution: A few days earlier Helen had been operated on. Before boarding the plane, she had to go through the metal detector, which kept going off, despite the fact that she had removed everything metal she had on. After an X-ray examination, it was discovered that the doctors had left a scalpel inside her body. If Helen had not discovered it in time, she would died for sure.
